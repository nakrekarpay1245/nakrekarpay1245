# Erkan Yaprak - Game Developer & Designer

## About Me
Hello! I'm **Erkan Yaprak**, a professional game developer with over four years of experience. I began game development during my first year in Computer Engineering and entered the industry during my third year. Since then, Iâ€™ve worked on various projects using different game engines like Unity, Unreal Engine, and Godot. Most of my career has been spent with Unity, and I have professional experience in both game design and development.

In game design, I worked at **GNARLY Games**, where I contributed to hit projects such as **Agent Hunt** (50+ million downloads) and **Frontline Heroes** (25+ million downloads). I have also developed games at **Suitech Software**, **8Games**, and **Pasatempos Games**. My skills include Unity C# programming, game design, and developing tools for game engines.
