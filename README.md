# Erkan Yaprak - Game Developer & Designer

## About Me
Hello! I'm **Erkan Yaprak**, a professional game developer with over four years of experience. I began game development during my first year in Computer Engineering and entered the industry during my third year. Since then, Iâ€™ve worked on various projects using different game engines like Unity, Unreal Engine, and Godot. Most of my career has been spent with Unity, and I have professional experience in both game design and development.

In game design, I worked at **GNARLY Games**, where I contributed to hit projects such as **[Agent Hunt](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gnarlygamestudio.agenthunt&hl=en_US)** (50+ million downloads) and **[Frontline Heroes](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.GnarlyGameStudio.FrontlineHeroes&hl=en_US)** (25+ million downloads). I have also developed games at **Suitech Software**, **8Games**, and **Pasatempos Games**. My skills include Unity C# programming, game design, and developing tools for game engines.

## Projects

### [Parking Perfect! ðŸš—ðŸŽ®](https://github.com/nakrekarpay1245/ParkingGame)
#### Project Overview:

[![Parking Perfect! Gameplay](https://img.youtube.com/vi/WfJcOrbDuKw/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfJcOrbDuKw)

**Parking Perfect!** is an arcade-style car parking game designed for WebGL and Android platforms, built using **Unity Engine**. The game focuses on providing a fun and engaging car parking experience where players must navigate their vehicles into parking spaces without hitting any traffic cones. The game combines intuitive controls, smooth animations, and a dynamic economy system. 

Built with **SOLID** principles and Object-Oriented Programming (**OOP**) methodologies, the codebase emphasizes performance, clarity, and maintainability. Features such as **DOTween** for smooth transitions and **Scriptable Objects** for modular game data are also utilized to enhance gameplay and design.

#### Key Features:
- **Arcade-Style Car Controls**: Easy-to-learn, difficult-to-master controls using `W`, `A`, `S`, `D` keys for movement and `Space` for handbrake on WebGL, or on-screen buttons for mobile devices.
- **Dynamic Camera System**: An isometric camera follows the player's car smoothly, adjusting to the gameplay.
- **Damage and Health System**: Colliding with traffic cones reduces car health and lowers rewards. Avoiding all obstacles grants a perfect score and full rewards.
- **Stars and Economy**: Based on parking performance, players earn stars and in-game currency which can be used to unlock new cars.
- **Two Playable Cars**: Players can switch between two different vehicles, each offering a unique driving experience.
- **Ten Test Levels**: The game offers ten levels that challenge the playerâ€™s driving and parking skills.

#### Installation:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/ParkingPerfect.git
2. Open the project in Unity (Version 2022.3 or later recommended).
3. Switch the build target to either WebGL or Android.
4. Play in the editor or build and deploy the game to your platform of choice.
   
#### Usage:
- **Tutorial**: Create characters using custom editor tools, setting up movement, interactions, and animations.
- **WebGL**: Use W, A, S, D for movement and Space for the handbrake to control the car.
- **Android**: Use on-screen directional buttons and handbrake button to navigate.
Park the car in the designated area while avoiding obstacles (traffic cones). Perfect parking without any damage will grant maximum stars and rewards.
Visit the car gallery to change vehicles or purchase new ones using in-game currency.

#### Future Development:
- **More Levels**: Additional levels with varied complexity and unique layouts will be added to offer players a broader range of challenges.
- **More Cars**: Introducing more vehicles with diverse handling and performance characteristics.
- **Visual Enhancements**: Improve the scene's graphics and add more environmental elements to make the game more immersive and visually appealing.
- **Expanded Gameplay Mechanics**: Potential new gameplay features such as timed parking challenges, advanced physics-based puzzles, or even multiplayer modes.
